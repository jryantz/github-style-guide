# GitHub Style Guide

This guide will break down the style that I follow when building my repositories.

## Branches

**Release Branches**

These branches should be configured with branch protection, preventing contributors from merging directly into these branches.  Instead contributors should be required to submit a pull request which must be approved by at least one other contributor.

Examples:
`release/production`
`release/staging`
`release/development`
